It includes calendar visualization, recurring shifts, smart dashboards, exportable reports, and push notifications.

Target Audience:

Support workers

ABN/Freelance contractors

Shift-based professionals

🚀 CORE FEATURES (MVP)
Shift logging by date, start and end time (15-min intervals)

Recurring shifts: daily, weekly, custom patterns

Calendar view: monthly layout with color-coded shifts

Dashboard with:

Total hours for current and previous week

Daily averages

Days without entries

Smart notification system:

Push alert if no shift is logged for 3+ days

Exportable reports:

PDF and CSV

Filters by custom date ranges

Totals by day, shift, and range

User-based data isolation:

Each user accesses only their data

Authentication via Email or Google

🧱 ARCHITECTURE (Clean Architecture + SOLID Principles)
Modular codebase using Clean Architecture with separation of concerns.

Frontend:

React.js for web

React Native (with Expo) for mobile

TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for reusable UI components

Backend:

Node.js + Express (or Next.js API Routes)

Service/repository/controller pattern

Database:

Supabase with PostgreSQL and built-in Auth

Structured, normalized schema

Validation:

Frontend: Zod/Yup

Backend: Joi or middleware validators

Highlights:
Stateless API design

Edge Function or Cron Job to trigger alerts (e.g. inactivity notification)

Export handled in frontend (lightweight, no server load)

Potential CDN usage for frontend assets (Vercel)

Future-ready architecture for integrations (e.g., Xero, NDIS tools)

🔐 SECURITY FRAMEWORK
Authentication:

Supabase Auth (Google or Email/Password)

Authorization:

Row-level security to restrict DB access per user

Input validation:

All user inputs validated both client- and server-side

Encryption:

HTTPS enforced for all traffic

Encrypted at rest (Supabase default)

Attack protection:

Rate limiting for critical endpoints

XSS & CSRF protection

SQL injection prevention via ORM/query builders

User consent for data handling and export

📈 OBSERVABILITY & METRICS
Logging:

Structured logs via Winston (Node) or Supabase Logs

Monitoring Tools:

Sentry: Frontend and Backend error tracking

LogRocket: Session replay for frontend usage analysis

Metrics to track:

Uptime

API latency

Error rates (4xx/5xx)

Session duration

Weekly retention

Alerting:

Auto-alerts on login failures, export issues, cron failures
