📌 Feature Request: Roster Planning Functionality for Managers

Hi team —

We’d like to implement a new feature that allows managers to plan and assign shifts to employees via a visual weekly calendar, and for employees to view their assigned shifts from their own dashboards.

Here’s the scope of the request:

⸻

🎯 Goal

Allow users with the manager role to create, edit, and assign shifts for their team members using a calendar-style interface. Employees will be able to view their assigned shifts but not modify them.

⸻

✅ Functional Requirements

For Managers
	•	Access a “Roster Planner” section under the Team tab
	•	Weekly view: Rows = employees, Columns = days
	•	For each employee/day cell:
	•	Create new shift (start time, end time, optional notes, location, shift type/template)
	•	Edit or delete existing shift
	•	Duplicate shifts across days or weeks
	•	Prevent overlapping shifts (same employee, same time)
	•	All shifts are saved with:
	•	employee_id
	•	created_by (manager)
	•	status: scheduled (default)
	•	Optional: notes, location, template_id

For Employees
	•	In the My Shifts section:
	•	View assigned shifts in weekly or monthly calendar
	•	Each shift shows: date, time, notes, location
	•	(Optional) Ability to confirm or reject assigned shifts

⸻

🧱 Database Notes

Use or extend the shifts table with fields like:
	•	id, employee_id, created_by, date, start_time, end_time, status, notes, location, template_id, created_at, updated_at

⸻

🧑‍💻 API Endpoints

Manager
	•	POST /api/roster/shifts – assign shifts (bulk or single)
	•	PUT /api/roster/shifts/:id – edit shift
	•	DELETE /api/roster/shifts/:id – delete shift
	•	GET /api/roster?start=...&end=... – get full team shifts

Employee
	•	GET /api/my-shifts?start=...&end=... – get own shifts
	•	(Optional) confirm/reject endpoints

⸻

🔐 Access Control

Action	Employee	Manager
View own shifts	✅	✅
View all team shifts	❌	✅
Assign/edit/delete shifts	❌	✅


⸻

🧑‍🎨 UI Requirements

Manager view:
	•	Weekly grid (rows = employees, columns = days)
	•	Modal to assign/edit shifts per cell
	•	Copy/paste or drag to assign multiple shifts
	•	Use of templates (if available)

Employee view:
	•	Weekly or monthly calendar
	•	List of upcoming shifts
	•	Status: scheduled / confirmed / rejected (optional)

⸻

📲 Notifications (optional)
	•	Notify employees when a new shift is assigned
	•	Notify manager if a shift is rejected (if that flow is implemented)

⸻

Let me know if you need clarification or if you’d like this split into specific dev tasks.
Thanks!
